Is based on the old model of iron ingot.

Then save the hex/RGB code, and create an ingot with a program like [Pixelorama](https://orama-interactive.itch.io/pixelorama "Pixelorama") and  the color you have chosen paint all the ingot.
Now with white colors the pixels indicated in the figure.
Then, subtract the first RGB value with the first number indicated in the image (150).
Do the same with the other two values.
Now, with the RGB color obtained paint the pixels indicated in the image with yellow.
