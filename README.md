This is a free-to-use model for make the correct reflexes/shadows.<br>
Is based on the old model of iron ingot.<br>

### How to use
First, got to [color picker](https://www.google.com/search?q=color+picker&rlz=1C1GCEA_enIT828IT828&oq=color&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i57j0i271l3j69i60l2j69i61.1199j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8 "color picker") and choose a color (for example 16, 235, 227).<br>
Then save the hex/RGB code, and create an ingot with a program like [Pixelorama](https://orama-interactive.itch.io/pixelorama "Pixelorama") and the color you have chosen paint all the ingot.<br>
Now with white colors the pixels indicated in the figure.<br>
Then, subtract the first RGB value with the first number indicated in the image (150).<br>
Do the same with the other two values.<br>
Now, with the RGB color obtained paint the pixels indicated in the image with yellow.<br>
Do the same for all other color, and when you finish, your ingot is done.<br>
If a result is negative (for example 100-150) write 0.<br>
